        <br>A prehistoric looking bird, almost dinosaur-like. They are human-sized birds that are gentle,
        <br>but can be dangerous if provoked. They aren't harmful to humans if you bow to them and show respect.

    <p style="color: red;" style="font-size: 50px;">Facts about the Shoebill Stork:
        <br>*They make sound by clapping their beak really fast, and it sounds like a machine gun!
        <br>*They are around 5ft tall, but only weigh about 16 pounds! And yes, they can fly!
        <br>*They have a Kill Bill: their beaks can decapitate with ease and can even kill a small crocodile.
        <br>*They live in swamps and marshes in Africa.
        <br>*Their chances of survival at birth is low because they kill their siblings. They murder each other!
